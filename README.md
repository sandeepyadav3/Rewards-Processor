# Rewards-Processor

An API service that calculates the reward points earned for every receipt.

### Endpoint: Process Receipts

- Path: /receipts/process
- Method: POST
- Payload: Receipt JSON
- Response: JSON containing an id for the receipt

Takes in a JSON receipt and returns a JSON object with an ID generated by the code.
The ID returned is the ID that should be passed into /receipts/{id}/points to get the number of points the receipt was awarded.


### Endpoint: Fetch Points

- Path: /receipts/{id}/points
- Method: GET
- Response: A JSON object containing the number of points awarded.

A simple Getter endpoint that looks up the receipt by the ID and returns an object specifying the points awarded.


## Guide for points awarded

- One point for every alphanumeric character in the retailer name.
- 50 points if the total is a round dollar amount with no cents.
- 25 points if the total is a multiple of 0.25.
- 5 points for every two items on the receipt.
- If the trimmed length of the item description is a multiple of 3, multiply the price by 0.2 and round up to the nearest integer. The result is the number of points earned.
- 6 points if the day in the purchase date is odd.
- 10 points if the time of purchase is after 2:00pm and before 4:00pm.
